Eideticho is a simple app that acts as your Eidetic or photographic memory.

Many of us have a problem with remembering things. We frequently forget things so we use different means to store important information like a notebook, journal. For this purpose, there are also many note-taking apps and complex tools which have a lot of features and functionality. But this excessive feature makes these apps really heavy and hard to use. Most of the functionality is not needed for a day-to-day user and it is really hard to recall important memory from a mess of notes. So for many, these app doesn't provide any benefit, and they stop using them after some time.

Eideticho solves this issue. It is really simple to use an app that acts as a photographic memory. In this app, you can take a picture of the thing you want to remember with one click and attach a simple note with the picture. The picture note will be stored in a simple list timeline of your day. So it is super easy to find any particular memory you want to remember.In this app, you can take a photographic memory with one click and attach one simple note with it. It will be stored according to the time of the day in a list timeline view. You can easily recall any memory at any time in the day. After the day passed a new timeline will be created for a new day and the past 30 days timeline will be stored in the app. For storing a memory permanently there will be an option to give a star which will move a copy of the memory to stared section. To Forward memories, to the next day, there will be a flow button on memories by selecting that the memory will automatically go to the next day after the end of the day.
